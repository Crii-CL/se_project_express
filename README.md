# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

SE Project Express:

This project is focused on creating a server for a WTWR application. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization. We work with databases such as MongoDB to store our requests and use services like Postman to test them. Techniques employed in this project include using eslint to check for errors in the code, creating request models using mongoose and using controllers to handle them , and creating middleware to handle resource validation errors and authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
